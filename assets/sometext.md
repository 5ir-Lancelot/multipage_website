Write me some suggestions how to improve the simulation or what would be interesting to visualize as

[//]: # (Fazit:)
[//]: # (There are struggles that the pH is not converging for the two different ways )
[//]: # (1.When just adding NaHCO3 to the solution and then adding CO2 with equilibrium phases  I am not converging for  pCO2 -> 0)
[//]: # (2. compared to  adding NaHcO3 without eqilibrium phases command.)
[//]: # (this causes the pH to decrease when decreasing the pCO2 to 0   what makes no sense.)
