The tool sums all cation charges (Mg²⁺, Ca²⁺, Na⁺, K⁺) and all anion charges (Cl⁻, SO₄²⁻, NO₃⁻, plus Total Alkalinity).
The charge-balance error is given as a relative number. The absolute difference in charge is called the absolute charge imbalance.
The commonly accepted relative CBE for auqatic geochemistry is 5%. Thus values outside ±5 % are highlighted."


The relative charge-balance error (CBE) is calculated as:

$$
\text{CBE (%)} = \frac{\left| \sum \text{Cations} - \sum \text{Anions} \right|}{\left( \sum \text{Cations} + \sum \text{Anions} \right)/2} \times 100
$$

Where concentrations are expressed in milliequivalents per liter \[meq/L\].


The absolute charge imbalance is given by:

$$
\Delta Q = \sum \text{Cations charge} - \sum \text{Anions charge}
$$

Where $\Delta Q$ is in \[meq/L\].

The default values are the average composition for seawater. The CBE is not exactly zero because there are more ions than the major cations and anions contributing to the total charge. But A value smaller than 1 ia already a very good data quality.
