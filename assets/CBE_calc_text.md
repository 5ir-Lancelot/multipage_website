The tool calculates the sum of all cation charges (Mg²⁺, Ca²⁺, Na⁺, K⁺) and all anion charges (Cl⁻, SO₄²⁻, NO₃⁻, plus Total Alkalinity).  
The charge-balance error (CBE) is expressed as a relative percentage. The absolute difference in charge is referred to as the absolute charge imbalance.  
In aquatic geochemistry, a relative CBE within ±5% is generally considered acceptable. Values outside this range are highlighted for review.

The relative charge-balance error (CBE) is calculated as:

$$
\text{CBE (\%)} = \frac{\left| \sum \text{Cations} - \sum \text{Anions} \right|}{\left( \sum \text{Cations} + \sum \text{Anions} \right)} \times 100
$$

where concentrations are expressed in milliequivalents per liter \[meq/L\].

The absolute charge imbalance is defined as:

$$
\Delta Q = \sum \text{Cations charge} - \sum \text{Anions charge}
$$

where $\Delta Q$ is also in \[meq/L\].

The default values represent the average seawater composition. The CBE is not exactly zero because additional minor ions contribute to the total 
charge beyond the major cations and anions included here. However, a value smaller than 1% indicates very good data quality.
