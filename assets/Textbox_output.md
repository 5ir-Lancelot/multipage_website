# Ion Activity Product (IAP) and Saturation Index (SI)

The law of mass action in 1 determines the activities at the state of equilibrium, {A}eq and {B}eq:


(1) $$ K_{sp} \,=\, \dfrac{\{A\}^{a}\{B\}^{b}}{\{A_{a}B_{b}\}} \,=\, \{A\}^{a}\{B\}^{b} $$

(10) 	chem equilibrium: 	Ksp = {A}aeq {B}beq

However, a real solution may not be in the state of equilibrium. The non-equilibrium state is described by the ion activity product (IAP).4 It has the same math form as the equilibrium constant Ksp, but involves the actual activities, {A}actual and {B}actual:

(11) 	non-equilibrium: 	IAP = {A}aactual {B}bactual

The decadic logarithm of the ratio of IAP to Ksp defines of the saturation index:
(12) 	saturation index: 	SI

The saturation index is a useful quantity to determine whether the water is saturated, undersaturated, or supersaturated with respect to the given mineral:
SI = 0 	IAP = Ksp 	
saturated  (in chem equilibrium)
SI < 0 	IAP < Ksp 	
undersaturated
SI > 0 	IAP > Ksp 	
supersaturated
