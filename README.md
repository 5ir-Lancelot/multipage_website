# Basic structure

# Update

# How to add a new app ?

You need to make the link to it in the 'home_layout' function. Then inccorpertae the path at the 'display_page' function. Then teh user can find the path and is able to navigate to the app.
Next one needs to design a new design function for the new page this is then called by the 'display_page' function. Call the function  'xxxx_layout' .
Inside this function one designs how the page looks like. Below we need the @app_callback and the plotting function for the interactive plot in the new app.
